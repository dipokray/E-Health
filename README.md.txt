The report presents the development of an online health care application as a service. In this project, we developed a website which can help the patient to find their health problems in their daily life. A smart E-Health system is the online healthcare web application. It will help the patient to find the specialist doctor based on their diseases. On the other hand patient can select the symptoms without knowing the disease exactly. Then our application will help the patient to get a specialized doctor based on analyzing the symptoms. This application has been developed by content management system (CMS) using framework and written in Php MySQL, Ajax, java script, Bootstrap4 and CSS3 function. The application has been designed as a web based program to those users’, who are worried about their diseases and to get specialized doctor. A patient can also book appointment on online and doctor also can conform the booking. A patient can get the best doctor for our site .we think that our site will help the people who don’t know about their diseases but know about the symptom. Our site will be user friendly to the patient.
